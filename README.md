# ðŸš€ Text Summarization App with Streamlit and Hugging Face Transformers

## Overview
This Streamlit app uses the Hugging Face Transformers library to perform text summarization using the BART-large-CNN model. Users can input an article, and the app generates a concise summary of the content.

## Getting Started

Ensure you have Python installed. Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/summarization-app.git
cd summarization-app

**Create a virtual environment and install the required dependencies:**

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use 'venv\Scripts\activate'

streamlit run app.py
A new tab will open in your default web browser with the Summarization App. Enter an article, click the "Generate Summary" button, and the summarization will be displayed.
